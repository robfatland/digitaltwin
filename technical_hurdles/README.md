# Hurdles

What are the technical challenges involved in the 'recipe' given here? This outline may
help you evaluate what you are signing up to deal with. Notice that debugging tools 
figure prominently. 


* Obtaining the appropriate leaf-node technology
    * We use Arduino UNO
        * A microcontroller
        * Supported by a well-supported IDE
            * Programming language is C
        * 20+ I/O (sensor/control) connections available
            * Includes digital, e.g. I2C devices
            * Including analog-to-digital
        * Uses free supporting libraries for IoT connectivity
        * Cheap: $30 or $45 with some ancillary hardware
        * Vast array of add-on "shields" available
            * Specifically a cellular modem
        * Negatives
            * Limited memory
